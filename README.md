# Calculating the distance of two points!

import math

## How do we run the code?
1. Open the program code
2. Run the code
3. Enter the values for each variable
4. Take a look at the rounded distance displayed

## greet the user
print("Hi user input two points to calculate the distance!")

## ask the user to input the position of the 1st point
y1 = float(input("Enter y1: "))

## Ask the user to input the position of the 2nd point
x2 = float(input("Enter x2: "))
y2 = float(input("Enter y2: "))

## Compute the distance using the distance formula
distance = math.sqrt(math.pow(x2 - x1, 2) + math.pow(y2 - y1, 2))

## Displaying the rounded distance of the two points
print(f"The distance between the two points is: {distance:.2f}")
